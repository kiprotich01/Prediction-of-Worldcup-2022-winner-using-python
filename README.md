# FIFA World Cup 2022 Predictions
This project aims to predict the outcomes of the group stage, knockout stage, and final of the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. The predictions are based on historical data of previous FIFA World Cups and are made using statistical modeling techniques.

## Part 1: Data Scraping
The first step of the project is to gather historical data of FIFA World Cups. To do so, we scrape data from the FIFA website.

The code for data scraping can be found in the scrape.py file. This script uses the requests and beautifulsoup4 packages to make HTTP requests and parse the HTML content of web pages.

## Part 2: Data Cleaning
After gathering data from the FIFA website, we need to clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for statistical modeling. The code for data cleaning can be found in the clean.py file.

In this script, we clean and preprocess the following data:

Matches Data: We clean the data of all matches played in FIFA World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2018. We remove any invalid or incomplete data, fix any missing or inconsistent data, and convert data types where needed. We also add new columns to the data such as match outcome and goal difference.
Teams Data: We create a dictionary of all teams that have participated in FIFA World Cup tournaments from 1930 to 2018. The dictionary contains the name, FIFA code, and confederation of each team.
Fixtures Data: We create a schedule of matches for the FIFA World Cup 2022 based on the structure of the tournament. The schedule includes the group stage, knockout stage, and final.

## Part 3: Prediction
The final step of the project is to use the cleaned data to make predictions for the FIFA World Cup 2022. The code for making predictions can be found in the predict.py file.

In this script, we use the cleaned data to calculate the strength of each team and use statistical modeling techniques to predict the outcomes of matches in the group stage, knockout stage, and final.

The script also contains functions to update the tournament schedule based on the results of previous matches and to calculate the points and standings of teams in the group stage.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data scraping and statistical modeling techniques can be used to make predictions for a real-world event. The predictions made by this project can be used to inform and guide discussions and decisions about the FIFA World Cup 2022.
